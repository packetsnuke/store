== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are the modules in UltimateWoo identical to the version from WooThemes? =

The UltimateWoo modules are not 100% identical to the WooCommerce extensions but they are forked from those versions to provide similar functionality.

= Can I upgrade my UltimateWoo license? =

Yes, you can upgrade to a higher license at any time.

= What happens if I let my license expire? =

When your license expires, you won’t be able to access updates or support. However, you can continue to use the plugin as long as you wish. Licenses are not automatically renewed so you must remember to renew manually to avoid a loss of service. You will receive a notification before your license expires so you can avoid a lapse in service.
